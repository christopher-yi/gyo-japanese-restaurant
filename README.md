## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Another mock-up portfolio piece for a Japanese restaurant. This one has multiple pages and focuses on a more minimal and modern design with nice hi-res images and simpel but effective Javascript elements.

## Lessons Learned:

Working on this site really taught me a lot about cohesive web design in that simple elements showcased in a unique light can make for a simple but eye-catching look.
